# auto_memepage

This is a little freetime project in Python.\
This script currently only scrapes images from tumblr.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You need to rename `hashtags.txt.example` to `hashtags.txt` and provide a list of hashtags (each on a new line).
Also you have to rename and move `credentials.config.example` to `src/credentials.config` and provide proper Instagram-login credentials.

Then just run `app.py` with python3:

```bash
python3 app.py
```
